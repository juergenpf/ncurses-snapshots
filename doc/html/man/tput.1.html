       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-V</STRONG>


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  uses  the  <EM>terminfo</EM>  library  and  database to make the values of
       terminal-specific capabilities and information available to the  shell,
       to  initialize  or  reset  the terminal, or report the long name of the
       current (or  specified)  terminal  type.   When  retrieving  capability
       values, the result depends upon the capability's type.

       Boolean  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  sets its exit status to <STRONG>0</STRONG> if the terminal possesses <EM>cap-</EM>
                <EM>code,</EM> and <STRONG>1</STRONG> if it does not.

       integer  <STRONG>tput</STRONG> writes <EM>cap-code</EM>'s decimal value to  the  standard  output
                stream if defined (<STRONG>-1</STRONG> if it is not) followed by a newline.

       string   <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  writes <EM>cap-code</EM>'s value to the standard output stream if
                defined, without a trailing newline.

       Before using a value returned on the standard output,  the  application
       should  test  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>'s exit status (for example, using <STRONG>$?</STRONG> in <STRONG>sh(1)</STRONG>) to be
       sure it is <STRONG>0</STRONG>; see sections "EXIT STATUS" and "DIAGNOSTICS" below.   For
       a complete list of <EM>cap-codes,</EM> see <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Options">Options</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>-S</STRONG>     allows  more  than  one  capability per invocation of <STRONG>tput</STRONG>.  The
              capabilities must be passed to  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  from  the  standard  input
              instead  of  from the command line (see example).  Only one <EM>cap-</EM>
              <EM>code</EM> is allowed per line.  The <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option changes the meaning  of
              the  <STRONG>0</STRONG> and <STRONG>1</STRONG> Boolean and string exit statuses (see section "EXIT
              STATUS" below).

              Because some capabilities may use <EM>string</EM> parameters rather  than
              <EM>numbers</EM>, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> uses a table and the presence of parameters in its
              input to decide whether to use <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG>, and how  to  interpret
              the parameters.

       <STRONG>-T</STRONG><EM>type</EM> indicates  the  <EM>type</EM>  of  terminal.   Normally  this  option  is
              unnecessary, because the default is taken from  the  environment
              variable  <EM>TERM</EM>.   If  <STRONG>-T</STRONG>  is specified, then the shell variables
              <EM>LINES</EM> and <EM>COLUMNS</EM> will also be ignored.

       <STRONG>-V</STRONG>     reports the version of <EM>ncurses</EM> which was used in  this  program,
              and exits.

       <STRONG>-x</STRONG>     prevents <STRONG>tput</STRONG> from attempting to clear the scrollback buffer.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Commands">Commands</a></H3><PRE>
       A few commands (<STRONG>init</STRONG>, <STRONG>reset</STRONG> and <STRONG>longname</STRONG>) are special; they are defined
       by the <STRONG>tput</STRONG> program.  The others are the names of <EM>capabilities</EM> from the
       terminal  database  (see  <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>  for  a list).  Although <STRONG>init</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>reset</STRONG> resemble capability names,  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  uses  several  capabilities  to
       perform these special functions.

       <EM>cap-code</EM>
              indicates the capability from the terminal database.

              If  the  capability  is  a  string  that  takes  parameters, the
              arguments following the capability will be  used  as  parameters
              for the string.

              Most  parameters  are numbers.  Only a few terminal capabilities
              require string parameters; <STRONG>tput</STRONG> uses a table to decide which  to
              pass  as  strings.   Normally <STRONG>tput</STRONG> uses <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG> to perform the
              substitution.  If no parameters are given  for  the  capability,
              <STRONG>tput</STRONG> writes the string without performing the substitution.

       <STRONG>init</STRONG>   If  the terminal database is present and an entry for the user's
              terminal exists (see <STRONG>-T</STRONG><EM>type</EM>, above), the following will occur:

              (1)  first, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> retrieves the current  terminal  mode  settings
                   for your terminal.  It does this by successively testing

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the standard error,

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   standard output,

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   standard input and

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   ultimately "/dev/tty"

                   to   obtain  terminal  settings.   Having  retrieved  these
                   settings, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> remembers which file descriptor to use  when
                   updating settings.

              (2)  if  the  window  size cannot be obtained from the operating
                   system, but the terminal description (or environment, e.g.,
                   <EM>LINES</EM>  and  <EM>COLUMNS</EM>  variables  specify  this),  update the
                   operating system's notion of the window size.

              (3)  the terminal modes will be updated:

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry  will
                       be set in the tty driver,

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   tabs  expansion  will  be turned on or off according to
                       the specification in the entry, and

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   if tabs are not expanded, standard  tabs  will  be  set
                       (every 8 spaces).

              (4)  if  present,  the terminal's initialization strings will be
                   output as detailed in the <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG> section on  <EM>Tabs</EM>  <EM>and</EM>
                   <EM>Initialization</EM>,

              (5)  output is flushed.

              If  an  entry does not contain the information needed for any of
              these activities, that activity will silently be skipped.

       <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  This is similar to <STRONG>init</STRONG>, with two differences:

              (1)  before any other initialization, the terminal modes will be
                   reset to a "sane" state:

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   set cooked and echo modes,

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   turn off cbreak and raw modes,

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   turn on newline translation and

                   <STRONG>o</STRONG>   reset  any  unset  special  characters to their default
                       values

              (2)  Instead  of  putting  out   <EM>initialization</EM>   strings,   the
                   terminal's  <EM>reset</EM>  strings  will be output if present (<STRONG>rs1</STRONG>,
                   <STRONG>rs2</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs3</STRONG>, <STRONG>rf</STRONG>).  If the <EM>reset</EM> strings are not  present,  but
                   <EM>initialization</EM> strings are, the <EM>initialization</EM> strings will
                   be output.

              Otherwise, <STRONG>reset</STRONG> acts identically to <STRONG>init</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>longname</STRONG>
              If the terminal database is present and an entry for the  user's
              terminal exists (see <STRONG>-T</STRONG> <EM>type</EM> above), <STRONG>tput</STRONG> reports the terminal's
              description (or "long name") to the standard output,  without  a
              trailing newline.  See <STRONG><A HREF="term.5.html">term(5)</A></STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Aliases">Aliases</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  handles  the  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>, <STRONG>init</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset</STRONG> commands specially: it allows
       for the possibility that it is invoked by a link with those names.

       If <STRONG>tput</STRONG> is invoked by a link named <STRONG>reset</STRONG>, this has the same  effect  as
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>.   The  <STRONG><A HREF="tset.1.html">tset(1)</A></STRONG>  utility  also  treats  a  link named <STRONG>reset</STRONG>
       specially.

       Before <EM>ncurses</EM> 6.1, the two utilities were different from each other:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>tset</STRONG> utility reset the terminal modes and special  characters  (not
           done with <STRONG>tput</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On  the  other hand, <STRONG>tset</STRONG>'s repertoire of terminal capabilities for
           resetting the terminal was more limited, i.e., only  <STRONG>reset_1string</STRONG>,
           <STRONG>reset_2string</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>reset_file</STRONG>  in  contrast  to  the tab-stops and
           margins which are set by this utility.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The <STRONG>reset</STRONG> program is usually an alias for  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>,  because  of  this
           difference with resetting terminal modes and special characters.

       With  the  changes  made  for <EM>ncurses</EM> 6.1, the <EM>reset</EM> feature of the two
       programs is (mostly) the same.  A few differences remain:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The <STRONG>tset</STRONG> program waits  one  second  when  resetting,  in  case  it
           happens to be a hardware terminal.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  two  programs  write  the  terminal  initialization strings to
           different streams (i.e.,  the  standard  error  for  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  and  the
           standard output for <STRONG>tput</STRONG>).

           <STRONG>Note:</STRONG>   although   these   programs  write  to  different  streams,
           redirecting their output to a file will capture only part of  their
           actions.   The  changes  to  the terminal modes are not affected by
           redirecting the output.

       If <STRONG>tput</STRONG> is invoked by a link named <STRONG>init</STRONG>, this has the  same  effect  as
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>init</STRONG>.  Again, you are less likely to use that link because another
       program named <STRONG>init</STRONG> has a more well-established use.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Terminal-Size">Terminal Size</a></H3><PRE>
       Besides  the  special  commands  (e.g.,  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>),  tput  treats  certain
       terminfo   capabilities   specially:   <STRONG>lines</STRONG>   and  <STRONG>cols</STRONG>.   tput  calls
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG> to obtain the terminal size:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   first, it gets the size from the terminal database (which generally
           is  not  provided  for terminal emulators which do not have a fixed
           window size)

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   then it asks the operating system for the  terminal's  size  (which
           generally works, unless connecting via a serial line which does not
           support <EM>NAWS</EM>: negotiations about window size).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   finally, it inspects the environment variables  <EM>LINES</EM>  and  <EM>COLUMNS</EM>
           which may override the terminal size.

       If  the  <STRONG>-T</STRONG>  option  is given tput ignores the environment variables by
       calling  <STRONG>use_tioctl(TRUE)</STRONG>,  relying  upon  the  operating  system   (or
       finally, the terminal database).


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-EXIT-STATUS">EXIT STATUS</a></H2><PRE>
       If the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option is used, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> checks for errors from each line, and if
       any errors are found, will set the exit status to 4 plus the number  of
       lines  with  errors.  If no errors are found, the exit status is <STRONG>0</STRONG>.  No
       indication of which line failed can be given  so  exit  status  <STRONG>1</STRONG>  will
       never   appear.    Exit  statuses  <STRONG>2</STRONG>,  <STRONG>3</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>4</STRONG>  retain  their  usual
       interpretation.  If the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option is not used, the exit status  depends
       on the type of <EM>cap-code</EM>:

          <EM>Boolean</EM>
                 a value of <STRONG>0</STRONG> is set for TRUE and <STRONG>1</STRONG> for FALSE.

          <EM>string</EM> a  value  of  <STRONG>0</STRONG>  is  set  if the <EM>cap-code</EM> is defined for this
                 terminal <EM>type</EM> (the value of <EM>cap-code</EM> is returned on  standard
                 output);  a  value of <STRONG>1</STRONG> is set if <EM>cap-code</EM> is not defined for
                 this terminal <EM>type</EM> (nothing is written to standard output).

          <EM>integer</EM>
                 a value of <STRONG>0</STRONG> is  always  set,  whether  or  not  <EM>cap-code</EM>  is
                 defined  for this terminal <EM>type</EM>.  To determine if <EM>cap-code</EM> is
                 defined for this terminal <EM>type</EM>, the user must test the  value
                 written  to  standard  output.  A value of <STRONG>-1</STRONG> means that <EM>cap-</EM>
                 <EM>code</EM> is not defined for this terminal <EM>type</EM>.

          <EM>other</EM>  <STRONG>reset</STRONG> or <STRONG>init</STRONG> may fail to find their  respective  files.   In
                 that case, the exit status is set to 4 + <STRONG>errno</STRONG>.

       Any  other  exit  status  indicates an error; see section "DIAGNOSTICS"
       below.

       This  implementation  of  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  differs from AT&amp;T <STRONG>tput</STRONG> in two important
       areas:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <EM>cap-code</EM> writes to the standard output.  That need  not  be  a
           regular   terminal.   However,  the  subcommands  which  manipulate
           terminal modes may not use the standard output.

           The AT&amp;T implementation's <STRONG>init</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  commands  use  the  BSD
           (4.1c)   <STRONG>tset</STRONG>   source,   which  manipulates  terminal  modes.   It
           successively tries standard output, standard error, standard  input
           before falling back to "/dev/tty" and finally just assumes a 1200Bd
           terminal.  When updating terminal modes, it ignores errors.

           Until changes made after <EM>ncurses</EM> 6.0, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> did not modify  terminal
           modes.  <STRONG>tput</STRONG> now uses a similar scheme, using functions shared with
           <STRONG>tset</STRONG> (and ultimately based on the 4.4BSD <STRONG>tset</STRONG>).  If it is not  able
           to open a terminal, e.g., when running in <STRONG>cron(1)</STRONG>, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> will return
           an error.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   AT&amp;T <STRONG>tput</STRONG> guesses the type of its <EM>cap-code</EM> operands  by  seeing  if
           all of the characters are numeric, or not.

           Most  implementations  which  provide support for <EM>cap-code</EM> operands
           use the <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> function to expand parameters in it.   That  function
           expects  a mixture of numeric and string parameters, requiring <STRONG>tput</STRONG>
           to know which type to use.

           This implementation uses a table to determine the  parameter  types
           for  the  standard  <EM>cap-code</EM>  operands,  and  an  internal  library
           function to analyze nonstandard <EM>cap-code</EM> operands.

           Besides providing more reliable operation than  AT&amp;T's  utility,  a
           portability  problem  is  introduced  by  this analysis: An OpenBSD
           developer adapted the internal library  function  from  <EM>ncurses</EM>  to
           port  NetBSD's  termcap-based  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  to  terminfo.   That  had been
           modified to  interpret  multiple  commands  on  a  line.   Portable
           applications should not rely upon this feature; <EM>ncurses</EM> provides it
           to support applications written specifically for OpenBSD.

       This  implementation  (unlike  others)  can  accept  both  <EM>termcap</EM>  and
       <EM>terminfo</EM> names for the <EM>cap-code</EM> feature, if <EM>termcap</EM> support is compiled
       in.  However, the  predefined  <EM>termcap</EM>  and  <EM>terminfo</EM>  names  have  two
       ambiguities in this case (and the <EM>terminfo</EM> name is assumed):

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  <EM>termcap</EM>  name  <STRONG>dl</STRONG> corresponds to the <EM>terminfo</EM> name <STRONG>dl1</STRONG> (delete
           one line).
           The <EM>terminfo</EM> name <STRONG>dl</STRONG> corresponds to the <EM>termcap</EM> name <STRONG>DL</STRONG>  (delete  a
           given number of lines).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  <EM>termcap</EM>  name  <STRONG>ed</STRONG>  corresponds  to the <EM>terminfo</EM> name <STRONG>rmdc</STRONG> (end
           delete mode).
           The <EM>terminfo</EM> name <STRONG>ed</STRONG> corresponds to the <EM>termcap</EM> name <STRONG>cd</STRONG>  (clear  to
           end of screen).

       The  <STRONG>longname</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>-S</STRONG> options, and the parameter-substitution features
       used in the <STRONG>cup</STRONG> example, were not supported in AT&amp;T/USL  <EM>curses</EM>  before
       SVr4 (1989).  Later, 4.3BSD-Reno (1990) added support for <STRONG>longname</STRONG>, and
       NetBSD (1994) added support for the parameter-substitution features.

       IEEE  Std  1003.1/The  Open  Group    Base   Specifications   Issue   7
       (POSIX.1-2008)  documents  only the operands for <STRONG>clear</STRONG>, <STRONG>init</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset</STRONG>.
       There are a few interesting observations to make regarding that:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   In this implementation, <STRONG>clear</STRONG> is part of the <EM>cap-code</EM> support.  The
           others   (<STRONG>init</STRONG>   and   <STRONG>longname</STRONG>)  do  not  correspond  to  terminal
           capabilities.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Other  implementations  of  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  on  SVr4-based  systems  such  as
           Solaris,  IRIX64  and HP-UX as well as others such as AIX and Tru64
           provide support for <EM>cap-code</EM> operands.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A few platforms such as FreeBSD recognize termcap names rather than
           terminfo capability names in their respective <STRONG>tput</STRONG> commands.  Since
           2010, NetBSD's <STRONG>tput</STRONG> uses terminfo names.   Before  that,  it  (like
           FreeBSD) recognized termcap names.

           Beginning  in  2021,  FreeBSD uses the <EM>ncurses</EM> <STRONG>tput</STRONG>, configured for
           both terminfo (tested first) and termcap (as a fallback).

       Because (apparently) <EM>all</EM> of the certified Unix systems support the full
       set  of  capability names, the reasoning for documenting only a few may
       not be apparent.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <STRONG>tput</STRONG> differently, with <EM>cap-code</EM> and
           the other features used in this implementation.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   That  is,  there  are  two standards for <STRONG>tput</STRONG>: POSIX (a subset) and
           X/Open Curses (the full implementation).  POSIX documents a  subset
           to  avoid  the  complication  of  including  X/Open  Curses and the
           terminal capabilities database.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   While it is certainly possible to  write  a  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  program  without
           using  <EM>curses,</EM>  no  system  with a <EM>curses</EM> implementation provides a
           <STRONG>tput</STRONG> utility that does not also supply the <EM>cap-code</EM> feature.

       X/Open  Curses  Issue  7  (2009)  is  the  first  version  to  document
       utilities.  However that part of X/Open Curses does not follow existing
       practice (that is, System V <EM>curses</EM> behavior).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   It assigns exit status 4 to "invalid operand",  which  may  be  the
           same  as  <EM>unknown</EM>  <EM>capability</EM>.   For  instance, the source code for
           Solaris' xcurses uses the term "invalid" in this case.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   It assigns exit status 255  to  a  numeric  variable  that  is  not
           specified in the terminfo database.  That likely is a documentation
           error, confusing the <STRONG>-1</STRONG> written  to  the  standard  output  for  an
           absent or cancelled numeric value versus an (unsigned) exit status.

       The  various  Unix  systems  (AIX,  HP-UX,  Solaris)  use the same exit
       statuses as <EM>ncurses</EM>.

       NetBSD curses documents different exit statuses which do not correspond
       to either <EM>ncurses</EM> or X/Open.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  command  was begun by Bill Joy in 1980.  The initial version
       only cleared the screen.

       AT&amp;T System V provided a different <STRONG>tput</STRONG> command:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr2 provided  a  rudimentary  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  which  checked  the  parameter
           against  each  predefined capability and returned the corresponding
           value.  This  version  of  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  did  not  use  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG>  for  the
           capabilities which are parameterized.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr3 replaced that, a year later, by a more extensive program whose
           <STRONG>init</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  subcommands  (more  than  half  the  program)  were
           incorporated  from  the  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  feature of BSD <STRONG>tset</STRONG> written by Eric
           Allman.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4 added color initialization using the <STRONG>orig_colors</STRONG> and <STRONG>orig_pair</STRONG>
           capabilities in the <STRONG>init</STRONG> subcommand.

       Keith  Bostic  replaced  the  BSD  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  command  in  1989  with  a new
       implementation based on the AT&amp;T System V program <STRONG>tput</STRONG>.  Like the  AT&amp;T
       program,  Bostic's  version accepted some parameters named for <EM>terminfo</EM>
       capabilities (<STRONG>clear</STRONG>, <STRONG>init</STRONG>, <STRONG>longname</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset</STRONG>).   However  (because  he
       had  only  <EM>termcap</EM>  available),  it  accepted  <EM>termcap</EM>  names for other
       capabilities.  Also, Bostic's BSD <STRONG>tput</STRONG> did not modify the terminal  I/O
       modes as the earlier BSD <STRONG>tset</STRONG> had done.

       At the same time, Bostic added a shell script named "clear", which used
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> to clear the screen.

       Both  of  these  appeared  in  4.4BSD,  becoming   the   "modern"   BSD
       implementation of <STRONG>tput</STRONG>.

       This  implementation of <STRONG>tput</STRONG> began from a different source than AT&amp;T or
       BSD: Ross Ridge's <EM>mytinfo</EM> package, published  on  <EM>comp.sources.unix</EM>  in
       December  1992.   Ridge's  program  made  more sophisticated use of the
       terminal capabilities than the BSD program.   Eric  Raymond  used  that
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  program  (and  other  parts  of <EM>mytinfo</EM>) in <EM>ncurses</EM> in June 1995.
       Using the portions dealing with terminal  capabilities  almost  without
       change,   Raymond   made  improvements  to  the  way  the  command-line
       parameters were handled.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>init</STRONG>
            Initialize the terminal according to the type of terminal  in  the
            environment  variable  <EM>TERM</EM>.   This  command should be included in
            everyone's .profile after the environment variable <EM>TERM</EM>  has  been
            exported, as illustrated on the <STRONG>profile(5)</STRONG> manual page.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-T5620</STRONG> <STRONG>reset</STRONG>
            Reset  an  AT&amp;T  5620 terminal, overriding the type of terminal in
            the environment variable <EM>TERM</EM>.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG>
            Send the sequence to move the cursor to row <STRONG>0</STRONG>, column <STRONG>0</STRONG> (the upper
            left  corner  of  the  screen,  usually known as the "home" cursor
            position).

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>clear</STRONG>
            Echo the clear-screen sequence for the current terminal.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cols</STRONG>
            Print the number of columns for the current terminal.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-T450</STRONG> <STRONG>cols</STRONG>
            Print the number of columns for the 450 terminal.

       <STRONG>bold=`tput</STRONG> <STRONG>smso`</STRONG> <STRONG>offbold=`tput</STRONG> <STRONG>rmso`</STRONG>
            Set the shell variables <STRONG>bold</STRONG>, to begin  stand-out  mode  sequence,
            and  <STRONG>offbold</STRONG>,  to  end  standout  mode  sequence,  for the current
            terminal.  This might be followed by a prompt: <STRONG>echo</STRONG> <STRONG>"${bold}Please</STRONG>
            <STRONG>type</STRONG> <STRONG>in</STRONG> <STRONG>your</STRONG> <STRONG>name:</STRONG> <STRONG>${offbold}\c"</STRONG>

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>hc</STRONG>
            Set exit status to indicate if the current terminal is a hard copy
            terminal.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG> <STRONG>23</STRONG> <STRONG>4</STRONG>
            Send the sequence to move the cursor to row 23, column 4.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG>
            Send the terminfo string for cursor-movement, with  no  parameters
            substituted.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>longname</STRONG>
            Print  the  long  name  from the <EM>terminfo</EM> database for the type of
            terminal specified in the environment variable <EM>TERM</EM>.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-S</STRONG>
            The <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option can be profitably used with a shell "here document".

            $ <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-S</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;&lt;!</STRONG>
            &gt; <STRONG>clear</STRONG>
            &gt; <STRONG>cup</STRONG> <STRONG>10</STRONG> <STRONG>10</STRONG>
            &gt; <STRONG>bold</STRONG>
            &gt; <STRONG>!</STRONG>

            We see <STRONG>tput</STRONG> processing several capabilities in one invocation.  It
            clears the screen, moves the cursor to position (10, 10) and turns
            on bold (extra bright) mode.

            The same sequence of commands can be combined  using  the  OpenBSD
            feature:

            $ <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>clear</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG> <STRONG>10</STRONG> <STRONG>10</STRONG> <STRONG>bold</STRONG>
